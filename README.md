# 🅲 C_BUILDS

A collection of C programs, exercises, experiments, and daily builds created to improve coding skills, explore new concepts, and develop practical tools.

## 📘 Overview

**C_BUILDS** is a structured collection of C solutions to coding problems from various competitive programming and interview preparation platforms. This repository serves as a personal practice archive where I solve, store, and review problems to improve my C programming skills, strengthen my logic, and prepare for technical assessments.

The goals of this repository are to:-

- Build a strong foundation in C programming and problem-solving
- Practice algorithms and data structures through real coding challenges
- Organize solutions by platform for easy reference
- Maintain a record of my learning journey
- Provide clean, readable, and well-structured C code

This repository grows gradually as I solve new problems from platforms such as LeetCode, HackerRank, CodeChef, Codeforces, and more.
